            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <!-- Paragraph describing the company's history -->
            <p>In 2020, after the Covid pandemic, a small group of entrepreneurs and white water rafting enthusiasts came together to commence what has grown to become, Rapids Rafting Co.  It all begun as 
                a pastime, but has now grown to be a semblance of a club of a modest 504 clientelles from 10 countries.  We pride ourselves in knowing each member of our growing patrons as part of the RAPIDS  family.  The rafting business is our passion and we strive to ignite the same in you from your next journey with us. Here are two more things that set Rapids Rafting apart:
                Unique Clientele: Our focus on small group sizes and personalized experiences fosters a sense of community on the river. Unlike impersonal mass rafting companies, you'll feel like you're paddling with friends.
                Local Expertise: Our guides are not just rafting enthusiasts, they are local experts who are passionate about sharing their knowledge of the area's history, geography, and wildlife.</p>
